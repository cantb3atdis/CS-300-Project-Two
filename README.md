# CS-300-Project-Two
Throughout this course, I worked on developing an advising assistance software for the Computer Science department at ABCU. The goal of the project was to create a program that could load data from a file, store it in a data structure, and allow advisors to look up and display information about courses and their prerequisites.

To approach this problem, I first studied and analyzed the requirements provided in the project description. I then researched and selected appropriate data structures to use based on their strengths and weaknesses for the specific requirements. Throughout the project, I constantly iterated and improved my designs and implementations based on feedback and peer reviews.

While working on the project, I encountered some roadblocks related to properly reading and parsing data from the input file. However, I was able to overcome these issues by breaking down the problem into smaller parts and testing each part incrementally to identify and fix any errors.

Working on this project has expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs. I learned how to better analyze requirements, select appropriate data structures, and use pseudocode and other techniques to plan and implement solutions. I also gained experience working with command-line programs and best practices for error handling and code readability.

Through this project, I have evolved the way I write programs to be more maintainable, readable, and adaptable. I have learned to use in-line comments and appropriate naming conventions to improve code readability, and to follow industry standard best practices for error handling and data validation to ensure my programs are maintainable and adaptable.
